INTRODUCTION

As a major player in the telecommunications industry, GLO faces stiff competition and needs to prioritize customer retention to stay ahead. This project aims to tackle the challenge of customer churn by analyzing subscriber data and behavior in Q1 2025.

Our goal is to identify the key factors driving customers away and develop predictive models that can spot high-risk customers. By understanding what drives churn, we can inform targeted strategies to improve customer experience, reduce churn rates, and ultimately drive business growth.

PROBLEM BEING ADDRESSED

Customer churn results in lost revenue and increased costs to acquire new customers. We risk falling behind our competitors if we don’t address this issue. By analyzing customer data and behavior, we can develop effective retention strategies that benefit GLO and its customers.

Potential Analysis & Questions

Customer Churn Rate — What are the overall churn rates, and how do they vary across customer demographics (age, gender, state, etc.) and subscription plans?

Purchase Behavior and Revenue Impact — How do purchase frequency, data usage, and total revenue correlate with churn? Do customers with higher engagement (e.g., more purchases, more data usage) show lower churn rates?

Subscription Plans and Churn — Which subscription plans have the highest churn rates? How do pricing, plan benefits, and service offerings impact customer retention?

Regional Analysis — Are there specific states with higher churn rates? How do regional factors (e.g., network quality, local competition) influence churn patterns?

Reasons for Churn — What are the top reasons customers give for leaving GLO, and how can these be addressed to improve retention?

Potential Insights

Churn and Demographics — Younger customers and those in certain states may exhibit higher churn rates, highlighting areas for targeted retention efforts.

Satisfaction and Retention — Customers with lower satisfaction ratings are more likely to churn, indicating that improving customer experience is crucial for retention.

Subscription Plans and Revenue Impact — Some subscription plans might be associated with higher churn rates, suggesting that pricing and plan benefits need refinement to retain customers.

Device Ownership Influence — Customers who own GLO devices may churn at lower rates, indicating that device offerings could play a role in improving customer loyalty.

Regional Churn Variations — Certain regions or states with higher churn rates may point to network quality or competitive pricing as factors driving customer defection.

Data Usage and Churn — Customers with low data usage could be more likely to churn, suggesting that higher data engagement might correlate with better retention.

In-Analysis Observations

1. High Churn Rate (~29.2%). 284 out of 974 customers churned. Highest churn in Abuja (15), Imo (15), Kebbi (14), Yobe (13), and Benue (13).

2. Top Churn Reasons Are Service and Price-Based

Top 3 churn reasons: High Call Tariffs (54)

Better Competitor Offers (52) Poor Network (45)

3. Abuja has High Customer Count and High Churn

42 total customers, 15 churned — over 35% churn rate in FCT.

4. Top 6 Plans Contribute ₦145.5M (73%) of Total Revenue. The 1.5TB Yearly Plan alone made ₦40.2M.

5. Poor Customer Service Cited by 34 Churned Users

Significant portion see service quality as a major issue.

In-Analysis Recommendations

1. Implement targeted retention strategies in these states (e.g., special offers, surveys, local engagement).
Introduce state-specific churn diagnostics to understand local drivers.

2. Repackage call and data plans to offer better value (e.g., combo bundles). Also, perform pricing audits vs competitors and launch competitive switching incentives.

3. Abuja should be prioritized for a pilot loyalty program, possibly with VIP service tiers or premium support.

4. Focus on retention of high-value plan subscribers with exclusive perks (e.g., double data weekends, VIP support). Promote these plans through targeted ads and renewal discounts.

5. Improve customer service training, response time, and offer self-service options (app/USSD). Implement automated satisfaction follow-ups after support interactions.

FINAL INSIGHTS AND OBSERVATIONS

Revenue & Sales Patterns

Total revenue for Q1 is ₦199.3M with peaks in February (₦87.1M), followed by January (₦63.3M) and a dip in March (₦48.8M).
Top plans (like 1.5TB Yearly Plan) account for over 70% of total revenue.

Regional Performance

Customer base is widely spread, but some low-customer states like Lagos and Borno still show notable churn.
Meanwhile, Abuja has high customer volume and the highest churn, indicating dissatisfaction in a key market.

Satisfaction & Reviews

Customer satisfaction is polarized — over 40% rated GLO poorly (1 or 2 stars) while another 40% rated it positively (4 or 5 stars).
“Poor Customer Service” and “Fast Data Consumption” are among the key reasons for churn.

Recommendations

Revenue & Sales Patterns

1. Reinforce marketing for high-performing plans and offer renewal discounts or data bonuses.

2. Investigate why March revenue dropped and counter with seasonal promos or customer re-engagement strategies.

Regional Performance

3. Customer base is widely spread, but some low-customer states like Lagos and Borno still show notable churn.

4. Meanwhile, Abuja has high customer volume and the highest churn, indicating dissatisfaction in a key market.

Satisfaction & Reviews

5. Segment customers by satisfaction rate and launch feedback-based recovery campaigns for low scorers.

6. Improve customer service responsiveness and explore data-saving features or education around data usage

UNEXPECTED OUTCOMES
